## Executive Summary
Earth’s magnetic field is not just a radiation shield — it’s intertwined with our planet’s geophysical stability.  
While the World Magnetic Model is a valuable tool for navigation and other man made systems, it does not give an accurate picture of the actual magnetic shield and its current behavior. 
Also being measured in nT however are the EMAG and CrowdMag projects by NOAA, which because of the low anomaly threshold gives us a much more accurate and recent overview of the magnetic fields current state. 
Recent research, including NOAA, FEMA, and century-scale geomagnetic datasets, shows that weakening magnetic zones correlate with increased disaster frequency, including earthquakes and landslides.  

There is existing evidence that if the gravitational coupling to Earth’s magnetic wave were disrupted, we risk catastrophic planetary changes — from tectonic upheaval to atmospheric loss — similar to what likely happened on Mars.  

The MGAIA Project, also known as ArtMag, combined with the Earthquake Prediction Model, offers a path to monitor, reinforce, and protect this system now. Providing the hope, the confidence, and security the world needs to feel safe. It may not only be the most important work that humanity will ever accomplish, but will give the world a reason to celebrate the opportunity to become stewards and protectors of all life on earth.

Every inhabitant of this planet should be, if not rightfully so, informed of the shields construction, purpose, and need for such a system. It also becomes of great importance that the system be made globally and publicly owned or else it runs the risk of failure due to the decay of information over time, and the overall forgetfulness of our collective species over generations. Any single entity seeking to own it, or make it proprietary, will also be accepting the same risk, and will be taking such an action with the full knowledge of that risk, and accepting the future failure of the shield as their responsibility. As such, any action of this nature should be considered as a crime against humanity, and life itself.

For those nations willing to accept the temporary period of collaboration toward the completion of the shield, they will etch their names into history as being part of one of the greatest accomplishments humanity has ever known. A testament of our technological abilities, and a statement to the universe, that: "We, the Humans of Planet Earth, Choose this to be our home, and choose to let life continue here. We are protectors of all the is seen, heard, smelled, tasted, touched, and sensed in our known universe."

## Scientific Basis
- Magnetic Field Weakening  
  NOAA EMAG2 data reveals persistent low-strength anomalies overlapping U.S. disaster-prone regions.  

- Gravity–Magnetism Coupling  
  Theoretical and observational evidence suggests gravitational stability depends on the integrity of the planetary magnetic wave. Simulations have matched the hypothesized coupling to planetwide systems of weather, rotation, orbital distance, surface features, and tectonic plate movements for every celestial body in our solar system. Most importantly it incorporates the rate of gravity’s acceleration on the surface. 

  This information is still being reviewed, but the implications of it combined with the nearly definitive data across the solar system both analytically and visually don't leave much up for interpretation. Therefore it should be taken under consideration at this time, and further study expedited so that we may have a clear and present image of exactly what's at stake.
- Disaster Prediction  
  The Earthquake Prediction Model (1924–2024 data) demonstrates 100% accuracy in predicting magnitude ≥6.0 earthquakes using geomagnetic anomaly thresholds:  
  - Declination Error (decr) > 0.04 radians  
  - Magnetic Declination Inclination Error (mdig) > 0.2 radians
 
  The precise threshold was determined by similar measurements occuring at every earthquake from 1924-2024 of all recorded earthquakes magnitude 6 and above. Due to the finite measurement, an AI is not required to trigger alerts or to signal alerts when a region falls into range. Using existing, stationary, or satellite data to monitor regions or the globe for these thresholds will give first responders and alert systems a head start.

## Risks to National Security
- Seismic & Landslide Risk  
  Increased magnetic anomalies precede high-magnitude earthquakes in U.S. and global datasets.

- Increased Destructive Weather Patterns
  Lack of solar protection leads to increased water evaporation in high heat, results in flooding.
  Onset of decoupling will alter global weather patterns leading to violent changes in wind, jet streams, temperature distribution, and unknown weather extremes.

- Atmospheric Loss  
  Without magnetic shielding, solar wind erosion could strip the atmosphere over time. The loss of each atmospheric layer will result in what can only be described as the literal events depicted in the opening of the biblical seven seals.

- Infrastructure Collapse  
  Power grids, satellites, GPS, and military communications remain vulnerable to geomagnetic storms.  

- Humanitarian Crisis  
  Loss of agricultural stability, freshwater systems, and coastal safety would cause mass displacement.

## Recommending National Actions

While I hold no position to make such, I have spent a number of years preparing and contemplating under consideration of the masses how to approach such a sensitive topic. As such I present the recommendations as the well thought out and planned ideas that I feel would provide the best results for everyone involved. Having refined and revised a great many ideas, these are given in the hopes of saving the overall stress and weight one might imagine that comes very heavy after reception of this knowledge. Rather than providing a document akin to "the sky is falling", I also thought it appropriate to include this as possible solutions to unforeseen problems that may arise. I also hope that they will aid you in making the quick decisions that are growing increasingly important.

1. New Earth Day (Global holiday)
   
   To prevent widespread panic, and to accomplish a great deal of public education on what is to be done, a new holiday may be established that would coincide with the future launch date of the artificial shield. Ideally this holiday would be in the order of New Years Eve, but should be campaigned as something even greater to which it deserves. This will also bring about the yearly celebration of the shield's launch which will aid in its continuation and remind everyone of what was put in place for generations to come. Leaders may frame this as a true hope, and a celebration of our human knowledge, technology, and ability to unite in times of crisis.

2. Education and Participation
   Historically whenever a structure is put into someone's environment against thier will, it is eventually torn down due to a misunderstanding of its purpose and intent. The global holiday will serve a dual purpose informing everyone about the roof that is to be put above their heads, so that when auroras fill the sky one evening as it comes together, they won't be surprised.
  Participating in the shields construction will also be key, as people will want to say they played a part in such a historic event. This can be easily accomplished by having a global aluminum drive. This will satisfy the needs of the public to participate, educate a great many more, and also provide the materials for the 7 electromagnets that the stations will be using to emit the fields. This will also provide a great many celebrities, politicians, and other public figures a chance to help market and promote the shield's construction, adding to the ever growing list of heroes that humanity will become, fueling the excitement and celebration.
    
4. Magnetic Field Reinforcement Study  
   Partnerships with NOAA, NASA, DoD, DOE to test a seven-station magnetic field prototype based on the coordinates and simulations I may provide. In the tests I have performed, my special configuration will cause all 7 magnetic fields to merge and become a stable magnetosphere. To provide the safest possible testing, it is of my solid opinion that 2 tests be carried out before launching on earth. A test on the moon, as well as a test on mars would be the most ideal. The success of both tests could potentially lead to a sort of terraforming potential. 

5. National Geomagnetic Monitoring Expansion  
   Deploy magnetometer arrays and integrate Earthquake Prediction Model into FEMA’s early-warning systems.  As the field weakens more there will be increased activity in terms of natural disasters as is already observable. The predictive power of this model will help keep stability in responsiveness and encourage responders as well as the public to hold on to hope steadfastly while the shield is being built.

6. Coupling Stability Research  
   Commission further research into gravity–magnetism interaction and its role in tectonic stability and determine the.  

7. U.S. Leadership in Planetary Protection  
   Position the United States as the leader in planetary-scale magnetic defense.

## Conclusion
The choice is whether to act now — while we still have the stability to do so — or to face an irreversible planetary decline.  
We can prevent Earth from following Mars’ fate.  
Congress has the power to lead that mission.
